          <p>Since Basketball-Reference.com doesn't provide an API anymore, we used a basketball reference web scraper made by jaebradley. Since the scraper was designed for his project purposes, the way we could transform and manipulate the data was somewhat limited, but manageable.</p>
          <p>In order to train the Keras neural network model, we needed a fairly large amount of data. Since the current season wasn’t enough to train and test the model, we used data from the last five seasons. This was not the ideal dataset to train the model with, since there is variation in team skillsets and dynamics each season.</p>
          <p>When using the machine learning model, you can pre or manually set the weights for each feature. Since we are not basketball experts, we used the preset weights, but the machine learning may have been more accurate with domain knowledge.</p>

          <p>Using five years of NBA games data, the Keras neural network model was trained, tested and used to predict hypothetical and current season games. Even though the model had a high accuracy rate during testing, it only predicted 40% of the current season games correctly (4 out of 10 games since we completed the model). This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as the starting lineup varying from season to season and the cohesiveness of the team as a whole.</p>
          <p>After plotting the correlation between the home and away teams' features and outcomes, the strongest correlations were between points to assists, points to outcome, and assists to outcome. This makes sense, as assists are passes that result in points, and the team with the most points win. Features that are positively correlated with the corresponding team's outcome are points, assists and rebounds. Features that are negatively correlated with the corresponding team's outcome are turnovers and personal fouls.</p>
          <p>There is no single variable that can accurately predict the outcome of a game. It’s the combination of player skills, team dynamics, the adrenaline, and sometimes a little bit of luck that determines the outcome of the game, which is why basketball is exciting to watch!</p>
          <p>Overall, basketball is not only about numbers and data -- there is an analytics team that creates the playbook, and player skills are not completely enumerable.</p>
